# About My Project

Student Name:  Avery Allen
Student Email:  avallen@syr.edu

### What it does
It scrapes trip advisors best rated restaurants in Syracuse and creates and cleans a dataframe for this information where, at the end, will be able to run a streamlit that outputs specific restaurants given the users choice of food category, and graph that averages the rating by price range, and whether or not the price range matters for the quality of food. 

### How you run my project
First you run the scrapping.py using python, then the functions.py using python, after that you test the functions, and lastly you run main_program.py using streamlit.

### Other things you need to know
I talk more about the project in my reflection!
